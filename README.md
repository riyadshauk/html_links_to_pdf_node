Incomplete for now. I decided I'd spend a day to completely redo my original html_links_to_pdf repo. I didn't finish in a day. So this is what I have so far. I can easily finish with what I have in node.js, but it would be synchronous, which just isn't good enough. I want things to be asynchronous and super fast... That's where I was running into bugs. To be continued, at some point when I make more time, hopefully soon.
